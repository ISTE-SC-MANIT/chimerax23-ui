Step 7: 
Accept the invitation of your teammate. Remember that accepting an invitation will make your choice of playing in a team permanent. So accept any received invitations with caution. The member who sends the invitation becomes the Team Leader and the other member who accepts the invitation becomes the Team Helper.<br/><br/><br/>
